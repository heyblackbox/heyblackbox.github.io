            <p>I had a chance to lead the making of two design systems for different companies: once for a multichannel marketing platform, and, two years later, another one for a ridepooling service. This case study is about the marketing platform.</p>
            <br>

            
            <p>CrossEngage product is a sophisticated SaaS software that lets marketers research the user base, build complex user segments, plan and execute marketing communications using internal and external channels.</p> <p>As the product was transitioning from MVP into a scaling phase, there came a problem — features were designed and developed without a common practice in mind, meaning that there were different patterns utilised between features to achieve the same goal of the user. This resulted in confusion and steeper learning curve, problems with scaling features, longer onboarding time for new designers and developers. New features were developed, which only increased the UX debt.</p>
			
            <h3>Task</h3>

            <p>Having joined a few months ago and seeing all those problems, I felt that it was a right moment to step up and change the approach towards more design centricity and interconnectedness, even though this could seem to be an extra effort. There was no specific requirement for me to do it, but it was clear that ist's needed, so I came up with a proposal and got a green light to proceed.</p>

			<h3>Getting management and developer buy-in</h3>

            <p>Internal tasks like this are not easily prioritised, especially if there's a lot of ongoing work streams and there's no dedicated team. This was the case with the company at that time, but for me it was clear that there's hardly any way around it. I had series of meetings with CPO, CTO, PMs, and key frontend developers, where I pitched the project and eventually got them onboard. We formed a task force and agreed to spend a share of our time on the design system.</p>

            <h3>Gathering information, setting up processes, building libraries</h3>

            <p>Any guidelines make sense only as long as there are people respecting and following them. So it was very important not to push too far with new process, but evolve existing ones, keeping the ownership distributed.</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li><b>Auditing the product and designing a library of assets.</b> To prepare the ground for a change, we have reviewed the product and wrote down a list of behaviours, components and assets that we want to keep. They have undergone a UI facelift, and were collected in a separate design document.</li>
                <li><b>Developing <a href="/xe-design-principles" target="_blank">design principles</a> from company values.</b>  I have conveyed a 3-phase research which resulted in a set of statements to be applied to a product. <a href="/xe-design-principles" target="_blank">Read about my research in a separate article.</a></li>
                <li><b>Building and launching a first version of a connected styleguide.</b> The styleguide examples were using literally the same styles as the product. So there was no way for the styles to diverge.</li>
                <li><b>Upgrading the styleguide into a design system.</b> This means including more guidelines and behaviours, describing components and writing style. Whenever a new element was developed, we agreed to add it to the design system first, and only then reuse it in the app. So every new component was also considered a building block, not a custom patch for a particular solution.</li>
            </ol>
            

            <h3>Results in the team</h3>

            <p>First thong we noticed is how peaceful our development and design processes became. It became clear which process to follow while developing the UI. There was less anxiety, and better output, as people started getting creative by reusing the existing components instead of constantly pulling in or building new ones.</p>

            <h3>Adoption</h3>

            <p>As the product experience started being more consistent, there was an immediate Customer NPS score increase. There were less complaints, and if there were, there were much easier to translate into feature requests, as the design language stopped being a barrier between users and product builders.</p>
                
            <p>We could not afford redesigning the complete product immediately, upgrading the software piece by piece to new components and design approach. In the end it was clear that we did it at the right moment: as the product started to scale, the core product remained the same, but lots of new integrations and add-on functionalities were developed very quickly, which would be not possible to imagine without the design system.</p>

            <br><p>And here are a few screens from another design system which I have made two years later for a ridepooling service. The process was similar, since the company also did not have design guidelines in place before we started. Getting the buy-in, setting up new processes, and planning adoption were also necessary.</p>
