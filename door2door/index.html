      <p>I worked with door2door ridepooling service in Berlin for nearly five years. During this time I had a chance to influence the product on different levels: strategic discovery, Design Ops, and creating experiences for mobile and web applications.</p>


      <h3>Using design methods to influence product strategy</h3>

      <p>Sometimes the problem to be solved is not very clearly defined, but there’s an evidence of its importance.</p>
      <p>The product team is facing questions like these: How to understand the effort needed to solve it? Will the solution fit with product vision or will it diverge?</p>

      <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="/images/ds-diagram.png" alt="What does design strategist do?">
      <p>Here is the point where strategic designer comes in. Working inbetween silos, such designer does research, explores and defines the problem space, facilitates ideation, validates early prototypes.</p>
      <p>Problem gets defined better, early solution concepts are being developed, for which the efforts can get estimated. All this happens even before the solution was prioritised for development.</p>
      <p>A prioritised concept then goes to feature teams (they are already aware of it and have partial ownership), where the concept is being further developed in close collaboration with the design strategist.</p>
      <p>Application of this technique resulted is much better shared understanding of overarching problems, which is often difficult to achieve from within team silos. It became noticeable while working on larger cross-team features that require long term commitment.</p>


      
      <h3>Redesign of a Driver application</h3>
        
      <p>An integral part of the ridepooling service in an app for drivers. It provides the driver with a necessaty information to begin or end a shift, pick up and drop off passengers at designated locations, navigate between locations and perform other tasks needed to effectively run a service.</p>
      
        <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="/images/d2d-driverapp.png" alt="Door2door driver app">

      <p>I have cocneptualised and designed a number of features that became parts of the app:</p> 
      <ul>
        <li>Increased legibility and contrast. As the app is used on a vehicle dashboard, the typographic grid was adjusted to make text readable from the driver's seat. Daylight and night modes were introduced for the same purpose.</li>
        <li>Seamless built-in navigation instead of triggering Google Maps to go to a next destination. This allowed for displaying importand contextual information while navigating, resulting in a safer and more focused driving.</li>
        <li>Driver-passenger communication functionality. When necessary, the driver can call passenger to give instructions on how to find a vehicle.</li>
        <li>Shift and break management: navigating the driver to a break location or to a shift end location allowed for better use of paid driver time, and better service utilisation in the end.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p>During field testing, I was regularly playing the driver role, driving cars and moving passengers myself, which every time gave me a lot of insight about what drivers need.</p>

      <h3>Designing management applications: realtime monitoring view,  shift planning view</h3>
      <p>The backoffice is where the user is meeting the complexity of the service and its possible scenarios.</p>
      
      <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="/images/d2d-webproducts.png" alt="Door2door driver app">
      <p>Here, in close coordination with product and tech leads, I have developed concepts and designs for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A vehicle schedule planner. Sounds short but it is a truly complex feature, which required extensive research.</li>
        <li>A web app to book rides over the phone, when passengers without mobile app are calling an agent — a must have for a truly public service which does not have to be limited by smartphone users.</li>
        <li>A tool to manage fixed stops — these are virtual stops where pickups and dropoffs get snapped to. Managing those is important to quickly react to changes in the city environment.</li>
        <li>Numerous improvements and optimisations of the realtime monitoring view.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p>These are very high level listings of what I was involed with. I will be happy to share more details about my contribution and workflow.</p>
