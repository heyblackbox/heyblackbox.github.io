            <p>CrossEngage is a customer data platform — a marketing software that lets companies research the userbase, build sophisticated user segments and develop marketing communications accordingly. Managers using the software are working with complex flows like campaign builders, event journey builders and segment editors.</p>

			<h3>How design principles got important for us.</h3>

            <p>As the product matured, we have noticed that designers, developers and stakeholders sometimes have different ideas about design of the same feature. Yesterday the decision was made in favor of one idea, tomorrow in favor of the other idea. And both ideas were good. For example:</p>
            <p>A: “We should simplify the flow so users would not be confused by the options they do not need.”</p>
            <p>B: “We should expose power user options because power users are the core.”</p>

            <p>While both ideas were good ideas, the variable approach could create a feeling of unpredictability and inconsistency for users.</p>

            <h3>The goal</h3>

            <p>When the product is made following the same ideas down to every detail, its character and personality shine through. Users think less about how it will behave, but more start knowing it by heart. This was the goal we were aiming for.</p>

            <h3>The process</h3>


            <p>The rule makes sense only if it is being followed. Writing the principles, and sharing them top-down as a piece of sacred knowledge would hardly work from the beginning. The rules would stick only if the team will own them.</p>

            <ol>
            <li>I have prepared and sent the surveys to about 20 people in the team. I have asked them what feels right or wrong in the product, and what makes the product special. As a preparation before the interviews, the survey made people tune into the holistic way of thinking.</li>
            <li>I have made a personal interview with each person. I have explained the goal of having the principles. We discussed which problems people have, how designers could make their life better, and what they think makes the product special. I wrote down everyone’s ideas. Funny enough, many people mentioned “easy to use” or “great ux” as if these things were design rules, while they are actually results of following design rules. The interviews were good fun and full of insight for both sides. </li>
            <li>Third, I have clustered the ideas into chunks, and tried to write them as simple sentences with clear explainations. That’s how the first version of the principles was born. </li>
            <li>We made group feedback sessions, corrected and clarified the writing.</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <p>We got 5 statements that were specific to CrossEngage, and we knew exactly what these rules stand for:</p>
            
            <h3>Clarity over brevity.</h3>
            <p>Application should provide enough context to clearly explain it's state and flow, even it may result in sacrificing aesthetics. In case of CrossEngage, "clear UI" means that it does not create confusion.</p></li>

            <h3>Confident decisions over immediate actions.</h3>
            <p>To help marketers be confident at work, software should provide enough relevant information at the moment of making the decision.</p>

            <h3>Care for different skill levels.</h3>
            <p>Users with both low and high levels of experience should feel comfortable with the software. Non skilled users should have an easy start and see a path forward. Power users should know where to find the features they need.</p>

            <h3>Transparency with third party.</h3>
            <p>If performance depends on the third party software integrated with user’s consent, we should clearly communicate third party interactions and errors to the user, so that they know where the problem is coming from.</p>

            <h3>Familiar patterns over customizations.</h3>
            <p>CrossEngage users need to learn some abstractions to operate in a less cluttered UI. To make learning faster, patterns have to be consistent, even though some better fit can be achieved by redefining the pattern or introducing a new one.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The principles are the keystone of <a href="/xe-design-system" target="_blank">CrossEngage Design System</a>, this way getting stronger connected to the product and to the team.</a></p>
