          <h3>Summary</h3>
          <ul>
              <li>I have overhauled a driver app of the ridepooling service, upgrading it from barebone MVP to a solid and scalable part of the product offering.</li>
              <li>Rethought app design principles and guidelines for a diver-specific context. </li>
              <li>Unlocked new business opportunities by combining new architecture with critical features (built-in navigation, voice calls).</li>
              <li>Reduced on-trip driver distractions by 50%, subsantially improving safety.</li>
              <li>Significantly cut the number of related support tickets.</li>
          </ul>

            <h3>Situation</h3>
            <p>In a ridepooling service, a driver app provides an interface between the digital — an algorithm that decides which passengers should be picked and where — and a human who spends hours in a driver seat, meeting passengers and carrying them to the destination point. </p>

            <p>When I joined the team, the driver app already existed. But the drivers complained a lot, and it was not clear how the long list of features that should unlock new market segments, can be integrated into that app due to the way it was organized.  </p>
            
            <h3>My task</h3>
            <p>Identify and eliminate pain points of drivers, and redesign the internal structure of the app in a way that would unblock new business-critical features.</p>
            <h3>Solution discovery</h3>
            <p>After some domain research and first empathetic exercises, which involved using the app while driving the car and sitting behind the wheel, I wrote down principles that should apply to such interface. In fact the app has a lot in common with built-in car interfaces, where safety of the driver and the passenger comes first:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>When the vehicle is moving, the primary focus of the driver should be on driving. All other screens are secondary to windscreen.</li>
                <li>The driver should not have to change the posture to use the app. The app should provide enough legibility from a distance of ~ 1m.</li>
                <li>While driving, the physical controls work better as they can be manipulated without looking at them. But since we cannot provide physical controls in the app, the controls that are used while driving should be should be large and should prevent accidental interactions due to a shaking vehicle. </li>
                <li>Even when not driving, the driver may have a high cognitive load because of the routine tasks they may have to do at the same time: finding the passenger or resolving a conflict. To reduce the load, the app should deliver only the important contextual information at all times, and never actively ask for driver attention unless absolutely necessary.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>

            <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="/images/driver-app-cradle.jpg" alt="Door2door driver app">
            <p>Using the cradle (with an early prototype) to put the screen at the distance</p>
            <br>
            <p>The design process included several loops of research, ideation and validation, during which I have:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Gathered knowledge about existing industry standards: vehicle human interface guidelines (like Google Design For Driving),</li>
                <li>Interviewed drivers at the existing installations across Germany,</li>
                <li>Created Figma prototypes and collected driver feedback on them,</li>
                <li>Drove the vehicle and used an app myself in the real context, as we ran a weekly test installation of the service
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <br>


            <p>The new concept included both structural and interface improvements as a result of my contribution:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Reworked user flow that included seamless built-in navigation instead of triggering Google Maps app,</li>
                <li>Better legibility and contrast. I have introduced a new typographic grid with larger base values  to make text readable from the driver's seat,</li>
                <li>Light and dark mode. Reducing eye strain and better legibility,</li>
                <li>Swipe gestures instead of button taps to avoid accidental butting triggering,</li>
                <li>Delightful interactions to soften "emotional dips" in the user journey,</li>
                <li>UI patterns, elements and microinteractions documented in Figma library</li>
            </ul> 

            <h3>Results</h3>  
          
              <ul>
                <li>On-trip app interactions minimised by at least 50%, enhancing safety for both passengers and drivers</li>
                <li>Dramatically reduced number of UX-related support tickets</li>
                <li>New business cases opened due to an upgraded scalable UI architecture</li>
                <li>Positive feedback from drivers and dispatchers about more efficient workflows</li>
              </ul>
