				<p>Fonoteka is one of my personal favorite projects. It was an app made for people like us. I made all product design work, from idea to release and beyond. Looking back, this work was a good practice of separating signal from the noise. We refined the flow a few times and shaved off features, even those we thought were cool, but not necessary.</p>
				
				<hr>
				
				<p>Fonoteka is not like another streaming music app. Put simply, it does just one thing &#8212; gives users access to several offline synced albums.</p>
				
		    <h3>Purpose of the app</h3>

		  	<p>Fonoteka is a way to enjoy portable music for those who prefer albums to automated streams. For those who see music as art, not entertainment. The app is designed to facilitate connections between user and a music album. </p>
				
				 <p>Strategically, Fonoteka was intended to be a part of the ecosystem within Zvooq music service, where each application is focused on a particular kind of interaction with music. More or less like Facebook did it with its Facebook for mobile, Messenger, and Paper.</p>
				 
		    <h3>Insights of the album listener</h3>
    
		    <p>I tried to examine and articulate problems with music listening. I reflected on my music habits, interviewed my music loving friends and observed commuters listening to music in public transport. We shared ideas within the product team:</p>
		    <ul>
		      <li>During a daily commute, there's not much time and attention available for music discovery. Discovering good music takes time and mental effort. In a mobile context, it's more important to have something known to be good.</li>
		      <li>Music lovers prefer albums to auto-generated playlists and streams of recommendations.</li>
		      <li>A person deeply interested in music normally has a "personal album chart" of a few current favorite albums. This personal chart may change day to day or week to week, but never all at once.</li>
		    	<li>Glitches and interruptions make it impossible to rely on streaming for commuting.</li>
		      		    </ul>
    
    
		    <h3>Disc changers were cool</h3>
    
		      <p>Remember car CD changers? It was awkward to put music in them, but once the album is in the changer, it is likely to be listened and maybe loved. At least there will be a certain personal connection.</p>
      </section>

	      <p>We wanted to create a convenient and beautiful way for daily commuters to enjoy albums. These people don't have time and attention to browse and select music when they have time to listen.</p>

		
			<h3>Concept: "album slots" for offline playback</h3>
			
			<p>This idea was bugging me, the concept of having a number of slots in the app, where each slot could hold an album offline. To listen to music, the user would have to put the album from the cloud into the slot.</p>
			
      </section>

		    <img class="img-responsive" src="/images/fonoteka_slots.png">
				
			<section class="copy-section">
			
			<p>The number of slots in the app was limited, therefore only a certain number of albums was available for listening at the same time. No streaming — the app would play only offline synced music. The limitations allowed us to negotiate the lowest subscription price possible: $1 per month.
			
			<p>Physicality of the interface allowed users to control music without paying close attention to the screen, which was convenient on the go. Interactions amplified the idea of slots and provided pure album listening experience.</p>
			</section>

				<p>The app was designed to complement the web service. While Zvooq's <a href="/zvooqweb">web interface</a> facilitated immersive discovery, Fonoteka provided mobile playback for discovered and collected music. Alternatively, the app offered search on the whole Zvooq catalog, and a section of swipable recommendations.</p>
				
				<p>Fonoteka offered a nice balance of features and a cool interface. Users appreciated simplicity of the interactions. With $1 per month subscription, it was the cheapest licensed music app on the market. But it definitely was not the app for everyone.</p>
				
				
			<h3>How it came to this design</h3>
			
				<p>Since Fonoteka was a pure offline player, the home screen should have provided access to playable saved albums, and a way to load new music. To denote the value of album, I wanted interactions to feel tactile. Gestures were a way to do it, they feel more natural compared to buttons, and did not clutter the UI.</p>

				<p class="caption text-center">Dragging?</p>
				
				<section class="copy-section">
				
				<p>The first idea was to use dragging for loading albums from the cloud. As you would put a tape into a deck or player. The idea failed because I could not figure out how to put the small slots at the bottom to use for playback.</p>
				
				<p>Then I extended the space outside the screen.</p>
				</section>
				
		    <img class="img-responsive" src="/images/fonoteka_sketch_2.png">
				
				<section class="copy-section">
					
				
					<p>This way users could always have a nice big album cover in the middle of the screen. Up and down swipes fit to "Play" and "Load/Replace" actions. We tested it internally and everyone seemed to like it.<p>
	    

	    <h3>Improvements based on testing</h3>
      
	    <p>Some decisions were based on the feedback and data we got after the soft-launch:
        
	    <p>Improved discovery for new users. The app worked nicely for existing users who had a collection of music from web service. For new users it initially offered only a search field as a way to get music. So, we added a section of recommendations, to make it easier for new users to start listening.</p>
        
	    <p>One price tier instead of two. Initially, the app offered two price tiers: 3 slots for $1/month and 7 slots for $2. After we tested the app with live subscribers, we understood that those two tiers make more questions than answers. We switched to one tier: 5 slots for $1/month with auto-renewable subscription.</p>
				
			<h3>What could have been done better</h3>
			
			<p>Similar to <a href="/zvooqweb">Zvooq web</a>, the core audience of Fonoteka were advanced music listeners. They loved the app.</p>

			<p>For other users coming from outside of the ecosystem, I think we made a classic mistake and did not put enough effort into onboarding them. The concept of the app is not straightforward, and data showed us that educating first time users needed improvement, and the onboarding slideshow definitely does not solve the problem.</p>
			
			<hr>
			<p>At some point after releasing Fonoteka, the whole Zvooq service pivoted from advanced audience towards mainstream. The next app, full-featured <a href="/zvooqmobile">Zvooq Mobile</a>, offered extended functionality, more expensive subscription and ad-supported free tier.</p>
				
			<p>Fonoteka app got more than 600K installs, 2nd place in Music in Russian App Store, 1st place in all apps in 7 countries: Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Moldova, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan.</p>
