        <h3>Unbunding music</h3>

        <p>Fonoteka was made to become a part of the ecosystem of multiple applications, each app focused on a particular type of user behavior.</p>
        <p>The goal of Fonoteka is to bring back the importance of music and album as a form of art.
        
        <h3>User problems</h3>
        
        <p>I reflected on my personal ways of listening and interactions with music. I asked my friends, especially those whom I consider music experts. I talked to my colleagues and some random people. A number of keypoints was set:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>During a daily commute there's not much time and attention for music discovery. Discovery mostly happens on web.</li>
          <li>People who are seriously into music still prefer albums to automated streams of "recommended content".</li>
          <li>Glitches and interruptions on mobile network are very annoying.</li>
          <li>At any given point in time, normally there's a "personal top chart" of 3-4-5 albums, current favorites.</li>
        </ul>
        
        
        <h3>Inspiration</h3>
        
          <p>Car CD changers of the past. It was horrible to go around and load CDs into the trunk, but there was a good side of it: more attention to music. You listen to what you have in the trunk, and you get really close to it. Not like radio hits.

        </div>
        </br>
                  
          <p>Hardware players with physical buttons. Toys. Actions that follow natural movements. Fluid interface is another way to get closer to the medium. Application or device can be as simple as a toy, but should work for real. Music control interface could be used while cycling in a heavy traffic, preferably without looking at the screen.</p>
  
        <h3>App look and feel</h3>

        <h3>Concept: Limited slots + gestures</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>No streaming, instead “borrow” up to 5 albums per day to listen offline.</li>
          <li>Limited number of slots to put albums — “CD changer” experience.</li>
          <li>Search of select music from your collection on Zvooq.</li>
          <li>Minimum buttons, maximum gestures for easy on-the-go operations.</li>
          <li>Subscription price — $1 due to limited number of offline slots</li>
        </ul>

      <h3>Business requirements</h3>
       <ul>
         <li>Monetization model: free trial + paid subscription. Subscription price must be as low as possible. Users in Russia’s highly pirated market were not ready to pay for full-featured service.
        <li>Increase the social acceptance of paid music vs piracy.</li>
        <li>Add value for both web and mobile parts of Zvooq music service.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Further improvements</h3>
      
      <p>After the first release, we improved a few things in the UX and monetization:
        
      <ul>
        <li>Discovery for new users. The app worked nicely for existing users who had a collection of music from web. For new users it offered only a search field to select new music. So we added a row of horizontally swipeable recommendations, to make it easier for new users to start.</li>
        
      <li>One price tier with a recurring subscription. In the first release the app offered two one-time purchases: $1 for 3 slots and $2 for 7 slots. Quite soon it became clear that 3 slots just did not feel like something cool and worth paying for, and 7 slots felt much better, even a bit too wide. We switched to recurring subscription and managed to get better terms: $1 recurring payments and 5 slots.</li>
      </ul>
