            Understanding context behind the wheel and designing for hours of use by a ridepooling service driver

            <p>In a ridepooling service, a driver app provides an interface between the digital — an algorithm that decides which passengers should be picked and where — and a human who spends hours in a driver seat, meeting passengers and carrying them to the destination point. </p>

            <p>When I joined the team, the driver app already existed. But the drivers complained a lot, and it was not clear how the long list of features that should unlock new market segments, can be integrated into that app due to the way it was organized.  </p>
            <h3>My task</h3>
            <p>My task was to identify pain points of drivers, design corresponding interactions, and redesign the internal structure of the app in a way that would unblock new business-critical features.</p>
            <h3>Solution discovery</h3>
            <p>After some domain research and first empathetic exercises, which involved using the app while driving the car and sitting behind the wheel, I wrote down principles that should apply to such interface. In fact the app has a lot in common with built-in car interfaces, where safety of the driver and the passenger comes first:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>When the vehicle is moving, the primary focus of the driver should be on driving. All other screens are secondary to windscreen.</li>
                <li>The driver should not have to change the posture to use the app. The app should provide enough legibility from a distance of ~ 1m.</li>
                <li>While driving, the physical controls work better as they can be manipulated without looking at them. But since we cannot provide physical controls in the app, the controls that are used while driving should be should be large and should prevent accidental interactions due to a shaking vehicle. </li>
                <li>Even when not driving, the driver may have a high cognitive load because of the routine tasks they may have to do at the same time: finding the passenger or resolving a conflict. To reduce the load, the app should deliver only the important contextual information at all times, and never actively ask for driver attention unless absolutely necessary.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>

            <p>Using the cradle (with an early prototype) to put the screen at the distance</p>
            <br>
            <p>The design process included several loops of research, ideation and validation, during which I have:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Gathered knowledge about existing industry standards: vehicle human interface guidelines (like Google Design For Driving),</li>
                <li>Interviewed drivers at the existing installations across Germany,</li>
                <li>Created Figma prototypes and collected driver feedback on them,</li>
                <li>Drove the vehicle and used an app myself in the real context, as we ran a weekly test installation of the service
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <br>
            <h3>Result</h3>

            <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="/images/d2d-driverapp-2.png" alt="Door2door driver app">

            <p>The new app concept included both structural and interface improvements:</p>


            <ul>
                <li>Redesigned user flow that included seamless built-in navigation (instead of triggering Google Maps to go to a next destination). This built in navigation allowed us to important contextual information and notifications while navigating, without having to switch apps, resulting in a safer and more focused driving</li>
                <li>Increased legibility and contrast. I have introduced a new typographic grid with larger base values  to make text readable from the driver's seat without leaning forward.</li>
                <li>Light and dark mode. Bright screen at night puts an unnecessary strain on the eyes when it’s dark, and after hours of driving gets very annoying.</li>
                <li>Swipe gestures instead of button taps prevented accidental taps for important actions such as pickup and dropoff</li>
                <li>Delightful interactions that softened the emotional dips in the user journey, such as  waiting for an incoming booking or approaching an end of the dinner break</li>

            </ul>

            <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="/images/d2d-driverapp.png" alt="Door2door driver app">
     
        <p>Obviously the implementation did not happen instantly, but after a few months of working side-by side with developer team, we had a “Driver app 2.0” released. </p>    
        
        <h3>Outcomes</h3>
        <p>We made a scalable driver interface that provided better safety in traffic, created less strain and cognitive load for the drivers, was much easier to use due to built in navigation and contextual information, and much more pleasant as a professional tool for day-to-day work. We started getting more positive feedback and dramatically less complaints, and opened new grounds for additional functionality that expanded the number of business cases possible for the service.</p>
